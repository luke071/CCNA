## Network scheme
Hobbits create computer network in the Shire. Create a table that contains the network address, host ranges, and broadcast address and subnet mask. Create a network diagram with subnetting. The initial LAN is 8.31.0.0/16  and the initial WAN is 152.42.168.0/20.  
  
Required number of devices in networks:

## VLAN
Make the following network diagram. Assign appropriate IP addresses to workstations.  
![alt text](./assets/vlan1.png)  
Create VLANs in switches and assign them appropriate interfaces. Start access mode on interfaces.  
![alt text](./assets/vlan2.png)  
Use the show vlan brief command to check if the interfaces are assigned to the indicated VLANs. Then configure the Sw2 switch similarly.
